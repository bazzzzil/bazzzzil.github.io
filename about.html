        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>Politicians around the world virtue signal their sympathy for Palestinians, but when pressed to enact material change to uplift their conditions, they fail to do anything substantive.
            The ongoing Gaza genocide has shown what people, and politicians, truly think about Arabs and Muslims - that our lives are dispensable, that brown and black bodies don't matter.
            How many deaths does it take for a condemnation of violence to be heard, for a ceasefire to be called?
            This tool is meant to track the "magic kill number" of politicians - the Human Exchange Rate of Palestinians, the point at which the Western world says "Enough".
            We will never forget.
