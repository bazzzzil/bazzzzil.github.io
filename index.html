    <p>This chart was created by recording the daily death toll from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker">Al Jazeera</a> using the Wayback Machine to scrub the website between October 9 and present day.<br>
    Notes: The Palestinian death count is widely thought to be underestimated due to to bodies trapped under the rubble as well as underreporting of deaths due to disease, thirst and/or starvation.<br>
    Total Israeli death count includes military and police. As of November 11, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/11/1212458974/israel-revises-death-toll-hamas-attacks-oct-7">Israeli sources</a> have confirmed the total deaths to be just under 1,200 (1,152 according to Haaretz), compared with the initial widely circulated number of 1,400.<br>
    A complete list is available from <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-19/ty-article-magazine/israels-dead-the-names-of-those-killed-in-hamas-massacres-and-the-israel-hamas-war/0000018b-325c-d450-a3af-7b5cf0210000">Haaretz</a>.<br>
    Deaths in the West Bank, also reported here, are due to state-sponsored settler violence and IDF attacks on West Bank protesters.<br>
